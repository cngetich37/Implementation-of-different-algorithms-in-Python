## Introduction

Are you looking to optimize your data processing tasks? Look no further! This repository provides clear and concise Python implementations of two fundamental algorithm families:

1. **Binary Search** - A versatile searching technique, both iterative and recursive, for efficient data retrieval.
2. **Bubble Sort** - A simple yet illustrative sorting algorithm, available in both ascending and descending flavors.

These algorithms are commonly used in computer science and can serve as a foundation for more complex data manipulation tasks.

## Implemented Algorithms

### Binary Search

1. **Iterative Binary Search**: Locate an item in a sorted list efficiently using an iterative approach.

2. **Recursive Binary Search**: Find an element in a sorted array through a recursive method.

### Bubble Sort

1. **Bubble Sort Ascending**: Sort an array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.

2. **Bubble Sort Descending**: Sort an array in descending order with bubble sort.

## Usage

You can easily integrate these algorithms into your Python projects. Here's a quick guide:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/binary-search-bubble-sort-python.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory:

   ```bash
   cd binary-search-bubble-sort-python
   ```

3. Import the desired algorithm in your Python code and utilize it as needed.

Example (Binary Search):

```python
from binary_search import iterative_binary_search

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
target = 7

result = iterative_binary_search(my_list, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
else:
    print("Element not found in the list.")
```

Example (Bubble Sort):

```python
from bubble_sort import bubble_sort_ascending

my_list = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
bubble_sort_ascending(my_list)
print("Sorted array is:", my_list)
```

Feel free to explore each algorithm's Python file for further usage examples.
